# 📱 Mob App Dev Journey

This repository documents my **mobile app development learning journey** — where I build and share small Android apps as I explore new concepts in **Kotlin** and **XML UI design**.

Each folder inside this repo represents a **mini project** or **concept-based app** that I’ve created while learning Android development from scratch.

## 🚀 Current Projects

### 🧮 Counter App
My first Android project — a simple **Counter App** that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a number with a clean, dark-themed UI.

**Features:**
- Dark modern design using ConstraintLayout  
- Three interactive buttons (Increment, Decrement, Reset)  
- Beginner-friendly Kotlin logic

## 🧠 Purpose
